# Brittle Star Control (BSC)
Repository to keep track of all the files I will be using throughout the development of the brittle star control (BSC)

Centralized_controller contains the code for a centralized controller with 1 neural network for the brittle star.

Centralized_controller_accelgor are copies to run on accelgor cores --> these files can be deleted and replaced by different files. The main files to work with are in the Centralized_controller directory.
